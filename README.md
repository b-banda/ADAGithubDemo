## Advanced Data Analysis - 2024 Class Survey

This project is an analysis of survey data collected from students enrolled in the Advanced Data Analysis course during Fall 2024. The analysis is conducted using the R programming language, with a focus on data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization. All scripts and results are documented and stored on GitHub to ensure full reproducibility [Here](https://github.com/b-banda/ADAGithubDemo/tree/main).

The data was collected through an online survey and consists of self-reported responses from students enrolled in the Advanced Data Analysis course during Fall 2024. It includes demographic information, hobbies, and other personal details, but no personally identifiable information is included. The data-set can be accessed through the following link on Github: [Class 1 Survey Fall 2024_di.csv](https://github.com/kijohnson/ADA-2024/blob/260833c0d0cc07cba1c7b510283ad91893f5f6bd/Class%201%20(Getting%20started%20and%20RR%20I)/Lab/Class%201%20Survey%20Fall%202024_di.csv).

The R code included aims to analyze the survey data using the R programming language, focusing on data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization. The analysis process is documented and stored on GitHub to ensure that all results are reproducible. The current analysis on the data includes;

-   Data leaning to handle missing values and inconsistencies.

-   Analyze the data using the `tidyverse` package, and

-   Visualization of the findings with `ggplot2`.
